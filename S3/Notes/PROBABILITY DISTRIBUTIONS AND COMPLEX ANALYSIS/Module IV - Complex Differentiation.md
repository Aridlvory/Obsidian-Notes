# Complex Numbers
A Complex number is denoted with $x + iy$, where $i = \sqrt{-1}$, $x$ is called **Real part** of $z$ and $y$ is called **Imaginary part** of complex number. 

The modulus of a complex number is given by $$|z| = \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}$$
The complex conjugate denoted by $$\bar{z} = x - iy$$
Polar form of a complex number is given by $$re^{i\theta} = r(cos{\theta} + isin{\theta})$$
where, $$r = |z| \ \& \ \theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{z})$$
A circle in the complex plane with the center $Z_0$ and radius $r$ is denoted by $$|Z - Z_{0} | = r$$
Similarly, $$a<|Z-Z_{0}|<b$$
is denoting an **annular region**

The Half Planes in the Complex planes are given by,
$$\begin{aligned}
x>0 \longrightarrow I \ \& \ IV \ \text{quadrants} \\
x<0 \longrightarrow II \ \& \ III \ \text{quadrants} \\
y>0 \longrightarrow I \ \& \ II \ \text{quadrants} \\
y<0 \longrightarrow III \ \& \ IV \ \text{quadrants}
\end{aligned}$$

# Complex Functions
A Complex function $f = u + iv$ with Real part $u$ and imaginary part $v$ which can be separated by substituting $z = x + iy$ 

Example, $$
\begin{aligned}
f(z) &= z^{2} \\
&= (x+iy)^{2} \\
&= x^{2}+y^{2}+2xiy \\
\end{aligned}$$
Here $u = x^{2}+y^{2}$ & $v = 2xy$.

# Limit of a Function
A **Function** is said to have a **limit** $L$ as $Z \rightarrow Z_{0}$ denoted as $$\lim\limits_{Z\to Z_{0}} f(z) = L $$
If $f$ is defined in the neighborhood of $Z_{0}$ and $f$ is close to $L$ for all the $Z$-value close to $Z_{0}$ 
$f$ is to be continuous at $z_{0}$ if, $$\lim\limits_{Z \to Z_{0}} f(z) = f(Z_{0})$$
> [!note] Note
To check continuity substitute $z=re^{i\theta}$ and take $r \to 0$ if $z_{0}= 0$
