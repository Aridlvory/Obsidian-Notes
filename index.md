This is a part of a hobby project done by [Aridlvory](https://github.com/Aridlvory) 

This is a website which hosts my notes and stuff 
i created this by using Obsidian to HTML conversion extension and using GitHub Pages

if you want to contribute to the HTML Pages you can contribute [here](https://github.com/Aridlvory/aridlvory.github.io)
and if you wish to edit my obsidian notes you can contribute to it through this [repository](https://github.com/Aridlvory/Obsidian-Notes)

The Website starts [[S3 Syllabus|Here]]

And I don't know for how long i can upload those notes so if u need any missing notes contact me (If you don't know how to contact me then you can't)

The progress of this website depends on contents taught in Mechanical 2023-27 A Batch Students
